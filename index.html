<p>
        While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. <br>
        Staying true to your mission, you've since joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. <br>
        Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for <br>
        potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.</p>

<p>
        As their Chief Data Analyst, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. <br>
        In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses <br>
        were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments <br>
        (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
</p>

<p>
        To do this you are tasked with:<br>
        <br>
        Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment. Creating a scatter plot that <br>
        shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment. Creating a scatter plot that <br>
        shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate) Creating a bar graph that compares the total % <br>
        tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
